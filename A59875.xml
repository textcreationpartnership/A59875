            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

               <hi>VVHen the Lord turned again the captivity of Zion, we were like them that dream. Then was our mouth filled with laughter, and our tongue with ſinging; then ſaid they among the heathen, The Lord hath done great things for them,</hi> 126 <hi>Pſ.</hi> 1, 2. Which the Pſalmiſt ſpoke of the deliverance of the Jews from the Babiloniſh captivity; but is very eaſily &amp; naturally applied to the occaſion of this preſent Solemnity. For I hope we have not ſo ſoon forgot with what ſurprizing Joy we beheld our baniſhed Prince return again to his Throne, who brought back with him our Laws, our Liberties, and our Religion; that is, brought <hi>England</hi> into <hi>England</hi> again, which was baniſhed with its Prince, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out changing its Place and Climate. And though that beloved and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mired Prince, who gave the firſt luſtre and glory to this day, now ſleeps with his Fathers, and has only leſt us the memory of his Princely Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues to adorn the Records of Time, and the Succesſion of Engliſh Kings yet this day ought not to be forgot, which reſtored to us not only a Mortal Prince, whom wee could not expect ſhould live for ever, but the Royal Family, which we hope and pray may be Immortal. Though the Great <hi>CHARLES</hi> be dead, the King lives ſtill in his Royal Bro<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ther, who was the Rightful Heir of his Crown, and the Partner of all his Joys and Sorrows, who was baniſhed with him, and who returned with him, and augmented the brightneſs of this day by his united Beams a Prince who equals the greateſt Examples of former Kings, and, as we have reaſon to hope, will leave a greater to thoſe who follow.</p>
            <p>It was not the Throngs and Crowds of People, which met their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turning Prince, nor thoſe loud and joyful acclamation<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> wh rewith they we comed him to his Country and Throne; it was not the external Pomp <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 span">

               </gap>
               <pb n="4" facs="tcp:36149:3"/>could make it; nay, it was not meerly the tranſporting ſight of a prince who was now endeared by long abſence, and by the Oppreſſions and Injuries of Uſurpers, who after ten thouſand Indignities returned with all the Expreſſions of a Princely Goodneſs and Indemnity: I ſay, though theſe were all very affecting Circumſtances, and added much to raiſe and heighten a preſent Paſſion, yet they were not the true Glory of this day, which conſiſted in reſtoring the Engliſh Monarchy in the Roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Line, for this we bleſs God, and for the continuance of this we pray this day, and if we believe King <hi>Solomon,</hi> there is great reaſon for both for it is as great a Bleſſing as any Nation can enjoy: <hi>Bleſſed art thou, O Land, when thy King is the Son of Nobles.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The words are ſo plain, that I cannot think of any plainer to expreſs their ſence by; and therefore not to looſe time in a needleſs Explicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, there are three things obſervable in them. 1. That Kingly Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is a great Bleſſing: for it cannot be a bleſſing to have our King the Son of Nobles, if it be not a Bleſſing to have a King. 2. That the noble Decent and Extraction of a King is a great Bleſſing to a Nation as my Text expreſly ſays, <hi>Bleſſed art thou, O Land,</hi> &amp;c. And the natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral inference from this is, 3. That an Hereditary Monarchy is a great Bleſſing: for we are ſecure, that our Kings are the Sons of Nobles, when the Son inherits the Fathers Crown.</p>
            <p n="1">1. That Kingly Government is a great Bleſſing. As for that diſpute, Whether Kingly Government be by <hi>Divine Right;</hi> if by <hi>Divine Right,</hi> we mean a poſitive Law and Inſtitution of God, that all Nations ſhall be governed by Kings, I finde no ſuch thing in Scripture, which is the only Revelation of the Divine Will; but if by Divine Right, we mean only ſuch an intimation of the will of God, as we can learn from the appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ances of nature and providence, I dare boldly affirm, that Kingly govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is by Divine Right; that is, is moſt agreeable to all thoſe notices we have of the Will of God from the original frame and conſtitution of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and from the diſpenſations of providence; which though it be not ſufficient to condemn all other Governments as unlawful, yet it advances Monarchy above all other Forms of Government, when it appears, that God himſelf has at leaſt given the preference to it.</p>
            <p>The Hiſtory of the Creation is a plain proof of this; for God made but one Man, to whom he gave the Dominion and Empire of the World, who was the natural Lord as well as Father of all his poſterity; which <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 span">

And therefore we find, when this orginal Title of Paternal Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty failed either by force and uſurpation, or for want of knowing the true Heir, yet Monarchy continued, and all the World was governed by Kings, and knew no other Government till Greece and <hi>Rome</hi> ſet the example, who changed the Regal Power into Ariſtocracies and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealths.</p>
            <p>And to ſatisfy us, that God ſtill approved of Kingly Government, even after the diſtruction made between Paternal and Regal Authority, we may obſerve, that by a poſitive inſtitution God e<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And when in time they grew weary of this, and affected the external pomp and ſplendor of a Court, and a viſible Soveraign Prince like their Neighbour Nations; though God was angry with them for rejecting his Government, yet he himſelf choſe them a King; and after <hi>Saul,</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſted <hi>David</hi> with the Regal Power, and entailed it on his Family. All this was done by the immediate order and appointment of God, which cannot be ſaid of any other form of Government. Ariſtocracies and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mocracies were a defection from Regal Power occaſioned by the ill Government of Princes, or by the giddineſs and licentious humour of the people, who are fond of Liberty, Power, and Innovations: But though God by his Providence permitted ſuch changes of Government, he never by a viſible Authority and Direction formed and modelled a Common-wealth as he did the Jewiſh Monarchy.</p>

               </gap> in the happy and flouriſhing State of his people. When his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom is well govern'd, his Subjects pleaſed and eaſie, this makes him beloved at home, and feared abroad. The Glory is intirely his own as the Shame and Diſhonous of a Miſgovernment is; which are ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry powerful paſſions in great Minds, but loſe their effect in popular Governments where the Glory and the Shame is divided among ſo many, that it is deſpiſed by all.</p>
            <p>We may expect a more impartial adminiſtration of Juſtice from a Soveraign Prince, who is equally concerned in all his Subjects, than when the power is divided among a great many, who have their ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Friends, Relations, and dependants to ſerve, and whoſe For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune does not ſet them above the Temptations of Bribery and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſtice. There is more apparent danger of Oppreſſion, when there are ſo many to raiſe their Fortunes by the Government, who have private Intereſts and Deſignes, and muſt be paid well for their pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Service. Whereas no Prince ought to think himſelf poor, while his Subjects are rich; and nothing can reaſonably tempt an Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditary Monarch to drain his Subjects to fill his own Exchequer, but their Factious or Sparing Humour; then indeed it concerns a Prince to get and to keep Money by him, when he finds ſo much occaſion for it, and ſees it ſo hard to come by. But this is the fault of the Subject, not of the Prince: for were Subjects dutiful and obedient, quiet and peaceable, and ready at all times to grant Supplies, as the ſupport of the Government needed, without difficulty or diſhonour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able terms; He muſt be a ſtrange Prince who would oppreſs his Subjects, when he knows he may have what he can reaſonably de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire, without oppreſſion; when his Subjects pockets are as open and a more increaſing Exchequer than his own:</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="9" facs="tcp:36149:5"/>
But the moſt fatal Cheat in popular Governments, is the name of Liberty, though the Power be as abſolute and deſpotical, as can be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſed by any Prince; and the only pretence of Liberty is this, that they are Slaves to their Equals, and enſlave one another by turns. But I ſhall ſay nothing to this, ſince our late dear-bought Experience has taught us the difference between the new modelled Government of our fellow Subjects, and of a natural Prince.</p>
            <p>So that though we can have no Mathematical certainty in theſe ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, yet all the fair appearances of Reaſon give the advantages for a happy Government on the ſide of Monarchy; the only danger is, if our Prince ſhould happen to prove a Tyrant, and then he may do almoſt as much miſchief as a Tyranical Commonwealth: for it is probable, that five hundred Tyrants would do more miſchief than one. But that which may equally happen under all Forms of Government, is an Argument againſt none. The Divine Providence will rectifie ſuch Miſcarriages, as cannot be prevented by any humane care. And yet this, which is the only posſible Objection againſt Monarchy, is in a great meaſure pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented by the Noble Extraction, and the generous Education of Princes; which is the ſecond thing obſervable in my Text.</p>

Theſe are God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like diſpoſitions of Mind, which (in that perfection, which is neceſſary to Government) ſeem to be originally owing to Nature, though they may be cultivated by the happy circumſtances of a Noble Birth and Education.</p>
            <p>It has been often obſerved both of Men and Beaſts, That they beget their like, not only as to their Kind and Species, but as to their peculiar Qualities and natural Vertues. A Child very often reſembles his Father as much in the natural endowments and perfections of Mind, as in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal ſhape; which is ſo certainly true, (whatever the Philoſophy of it be) That upon this account, the Sons of Nobles have the advantage of meaner Births. A great and generous Prince begets Princes qualified to ſway the Scepter, and born with a kind of natural inſtinct of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
            <p>And beſides this, the glory of their Birth does early inſpire them with great Thoughts, and they are trained up betimes in the Arts of Government. Thoſe univerſal Courtſhips and Addreſſes they receive, teach them greatneſs of Mind, mixt with affability, and a decent re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect to Inferiors; for thoſe who have been always accuſtomed to be treated with Ceremony and awful Regards, have a due ſenſe of Honour, but are not proud. For Honour ſeldom ſwells mens minds, but when it is new. A plentiful Fortune, to which they are born without their care and induſtry, is the beſt preſervative againſt Covetouſneſs, which is an ignoble Vice, and ſeldom poſſeſſes any Man, but him who has known, what it is to want, and what it is to get an eſtate.</p>
            <p>And thoſe who ſtand almoſt upon an even Level with the Throne (as the Sons of Kings do) have ſo eaſie an aſcent thither, That it does
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:36149:6"/>not turn their Heads with an unuſual height, which is the Common Effect, that a great and ſudden advancement has upon mean men, that they forget themſelves and their juſt Reſpects to Mankind, which makes them proud and inſolent Tyrants when they are poſſeſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> of Sovereign Power, which ſhows us, what a happineſs it is to live under the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of a Prince, who is Nobly deſcended; for ſuch Perſons, whatever other faults they may have; have ſuch Royal Vertues, as quality them for excellent Governours.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Nobility of Birth gives a Luſter and Authority to ſuch a Prince's Government. Men do not love to ſubmit to their Equals or Inferiors; when ſuch aſcend the Throne, they are deſpiſed and envied, and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but Force and Power can keep them there. But a High born Prince is the pride and the deſire of a Nation: he inherits the Glory of his Anceſtors; and the World preſages great things of him, who deſcends from a race of Kings; no man thinks much to ſubmit to him, who was born to govern, but thoſe, who are impatient of any Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, or ambitious of Government themſelves. We are contented to yield to th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">
                  <desc>•••</desc>
               </gap>, whoſe Glory we cannot rival, for Competition is only among equa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>s; and ſince the Government muſt be in ſome hand, it is moſt reaſonab<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>e to conſent in him, who by Birth and Fortune is advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced above all; and that muſt make any Government happy, which makes S<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>bjects wi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>ing to obey; and nothing can ſo univerſally diſpoſe people to a chearfull Obedience as this.</p>
            <p n="3">3. And this ſhows us the advantages of an Hereditary Monarchy. For the Royal Family is certainly the moſt Noble: a King, who is the Son of Kings, to be ſure is the Son of Nobles. And it is the higheſt and greateſt Nobility of which <hi>Solomon</hi> ſpeaks; to be ſure, what he ſays muſt be eminently true of the moſt Noble Blood. A King's Son, eſpecially if he deſcend from an Ancient race of Kings, has as much the advantage of Inferiour Nobles, as they have of the Gentry, or the Gentry of mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner People. It is Royal Blood, which inſpires a Princely Mind, which is more Noble ſtill the further it is removed from its Original.</p>
            <p>I cannot now diſcourſe to you concerning the Right of Succesſion; it ſeems moſt Natural for a Son to be Heir to his Father, and therefore to ſucceed to the Crown of which he dyed poſſeſſed for Power deſcends as well as an Eſtate, as the Government of the Family was the Birth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right of the Eldeſt Son, as his Fathers Heir. But however that be, if it
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:36149:7"/>be ſo great a Happineſs to a Nation to have a King the Son of Nobles, there is no ſuch way to ſecure this as by a Succeſſion of Kings of the ſame Royal Stock and Family, whoſe Glory and Nobility increaſes with every Succesſion, and gives a new Greatneſs and Authority to its Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment.</p>
            <p>But to haſten to a concluſion, the proper uſe of this diſcourſe conſiſts of two parts. 1. To bleſs God for the Mercy of this day. 2. To be Loy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al to our King,</p>
            <p n="1">1. To bleſs God for the Mercy of this Day. It would be too melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choly a Thought at this time to reflect on the ſad face of things in theſe Kingdoms, when an Excellent Prince was murdered by his own Subjects; the Natural Heir of the Crown, and the whole Royal Family forced into Baniſhment; the Ancient and Loyal Nobility and Gentry under Impri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonments and Sequeſtrations; the Church of <hi>England</hi> robbed of its Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops and Clergy, its Worſhip and Revenues, while ſome mean and ignoble perſons trampled upon Crowns and Mitres, enriched them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves with the ſpoils of Church and State, uſurped the Royal Power, but governed like Slaves. But this bleſſed Day put and end to all theſe Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeries and confuſions; God by a wonderful Providence reſtored to us our King and Royal Family in Peace and Triumph, without the noiſe and alarms of War, without drawing the Sword, or ſhedding Engliſh Blood. He was driven out by Victorious Rebels, at the expence of a vaſt Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, and more Blood; but was invited home again by a wearied and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtracted People, who now felt the difference between the Government of mean Uſurpers, and of a natural and High-born Prince.</p>
            <p>And thus the Nation recovered its ancient Glory, and every Subject their Juſt Rights; and which is more valuable than all Civil Rights, the free Profeſſion and Exerciſe of their Religion, according to the Doctrine and Worſhip of the Apoſtolick Church of <hi>England,</hi> though ſome poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly may think its too late to glory in this now; and it would be too late indeed, and would leſſen the Glory of this day, were the moſt Holy Religion of the Church of <hi>England</hi> in any danger. But next to having our King of the Communion of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> we can deſire no more, than to have a King, who will defend it; which I am ſure the <hi>Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive Chriſtians</hi> would have thought a great Bleſſing; and therefore this is a joyful day ſtill, which brought back one Prince to reſtore the Church of <hi>England,</hi> and another to protect it; for far be it from me, and from all
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:36149:7"/>Loyal Subjects to diſtruſt thoſe ſolemn and repeated aſſurances, which our King has given us of this Matter. A Prince, whoſe Mind is as Great and Noble as his Birth, who abhors all mean Arts and Equivocal Reſerves, and ſcorns either to diſſemble what he believes himſelf, or to ſpeak what he does not think.</p>
            <p n="2">2. As for Loyalty, were it decent to conclude a diſcourſe of Kingly Government without an Exhortation to Loyalty and Obedience, it might be very well ſpared at this time, in ſuch a preſence, whoſe Example preaches Loyalty to the whole Nation. And therefore I ſhall not run o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver all the Topicks of Obedience, but only urge ſome few things, which are proper to this argument, and to this preſent ſolemnity.</p>
            <p>It is a great Happineſs to a Nation to have a King, who is the Son of Nobles. This Happineſs we at this day enjoy; we live under the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of a King, who has Royal Blood in his Veins, and diſcovers a Great <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="14" facs="tcp:36149:8" rendition="simple:additions"/>Obligation on Princes to rule well; for Princes muſt value Obedience and Subjection as they do their Crowns.

            <p>And therefore to conclude, I would deſire you to obſerve, that it is a Church of <hi>England</hi> Loyalty I perſwade you to: This our King approves, commends, relies on, as a tried and experienced Loyalty, which has ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with its Prince, but never yet rebelled againſt him: a Loyalty upon firm and ſteady Principles, and without reſerve. And therefore to keep us true to our Prince, we muſt be true to our Church and to our Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. It is no Act of Loyalty to accomodate or complement away our Religion and its legal Securities; for if we change our Religion, we muſt change the Principles of our Loyalty too, and I am ſure the King and the Crown will gain nothing by that; for there is no ſuch laſting and immoveable Loyalty, as that of the Church of <hi>England.</hi> I deny not, but ſome, who are Papiſts, in ſome Junctures of Affairs may and have been very Loyal; but I am ſure the Popiſh Religion is not; the Engliſh man may be Loyal, but not the Papiſt; and yet there can be no ſecurity of thoſe mens Loyalty, whoſe Religion in any caſe teaches them to rebel.</p>
            <p>God grant the whole Nation may follow the Example of his Honour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Senate, to be Loyal to their Prince, Zealous for the Service of the Crown, and true to the Religion of the Church of <hi>England, as dearer i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
